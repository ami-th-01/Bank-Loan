# Bank Loan Report Query and Analysis using SQL

#### Description: 
###### Developed an end-to-end SQL project that generates key insights and performance indicators of the bank's loan portfolio. Writing complex SQL queries to extract the data on loan applications, funded amounts, and payment collections along with interest rates. Analyzed KPIs based on several factors such as periods (MTD, PMTD), loan status, and borrower demographics: state, term, employee length, and home ownership.


#### Key Features:

###### •	Total Applications and Amounts Funded
###### •	Monthly and Prior Month Loan Application and Payment Insights
###### •	Overview of Loan Status: Good vs. Bad Loans
###### •	Interest Rates and DTI Average Rates/DIT
###### •	Distribution of loans statewide and purposes
###### •	Data Exploration on Multiple Filters Dashboards
###### •	Borrower queries: employment length, home ownership, purpose of loan.


#### Technologies Used:

###### SQL and Excel for retrieving and aggregating data
###### Data filtering and comparison are done using various filters provided within dashboards. Creating a Dashboard using Excel. This project allowed me to analyze some of the critical metrics related to loans and present the results, using SQL queries in a way that is insightful and actionable. It was used to inform better financial decisions.
